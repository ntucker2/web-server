# Project - README

This is the [Final Project] for [CSE 20289 Systems Programming (Spring 2020)].

## Members

- Patrick McGrath (pmcgrat3@nd.edu)
- Nora Tucker (ntucker2@nd.edu)

## Demonstration

- [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xwwW7KJSIqeCrwWhHXLnZ58lux0c9qgc]()

## Errata

As far as we know, everything works well! We pass all test scripts, have no
valgrind errors, and our manual testing has shown nothing but success

## Contributions
Patrick: thor.py, most of the testing

Nora: spidey, ran some tests, coded the guru points after discussing
them with Patrick

Both of us worked closely together and helped with understanding concepts -
we simply split up the code to make it easier to keep track of changes
