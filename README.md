# Web Server - README

## Project Overview:
This is a basic HTTP server that supports directory listings, static files, and CGI scripts. I coded all programs associated with spidey.c which can be executed for a web server. Additionally, there are examples of test scripts that I authored to test the latency and throughput of my server.
** Also in this repository is a HTTP web client, which was authored by my project partner.
